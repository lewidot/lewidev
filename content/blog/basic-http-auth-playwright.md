There are multiple ways that authentication is implemented on a website, most commonly through a login form that requires users' credentials to be input. However, some sites may implement [Basic HTTP Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme) where credentials are requested by the server and need to be handled differently.

Letâ€™s start with writing a Python script that uses Playwright to visit a website that implements basic HTTP authentication.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth")
    page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
    browser.close()
```

Run the script and open the screenshot that this script captured, you will see something like this, stating that you are not authorised.

This page implements basic HTTP authentication which requires a username and password, these are both `admin` for this particular site. There are several ways to handle this with our Playwright script.

## Deprecated method using URL

The first method is to pass the credentials in the URL. This should work but is now [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#access_using_credentials_in_the_url) and not the recommended solution. We can tweak our script to include `admin:admin@` at the beginning of our URL.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto(
        "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth"
    )
    page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
    browser.close()
```

When we run this script now, we should see that the screenshot now shows a page confirming that we have provided the required credentials and accessed the webpage.

## Recommended method using Playwright browser context

Playwright provides us with a more modern solution, where we can pass these credentials into the browser context that we create in our script. To do this we can use the `browser.new_context()` method and pass in the username and password in a dictionary for the `http_credentials` argument. We can then create the page object from this browser context.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    context = browser.new_context(
        http_credentials={"username": "admin", "password": "admin"}
    )
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth")
    page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
    browser.close()
```

Checking the screenshot you will see that we can now successfully handle the authentication and access the website.
