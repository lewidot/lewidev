Why did I create this website? I have been learning programming in Python for the past 18 months and have developed a keen interest in testing and automation. I have found that there are limited resources in this area and so I decided that I wanted to create a online presence and share my knowledge. Therefore I decided to create a personal website where I can create content, provide resources and share anything that I find interesting.

I have tried a couple of platforms now to create a website such as [super](https://super.so) and [hashnode](https://hashnode.com). These platforms are both technically impressive and relatively easy to use but I wanted to create something minimal and with less creative restrictions. This landed me on [zola](https://www.getzola.org).

Zola is a static site generator built with Rust and so boasts reliability and speed. It gives a solid foundation for building a personal website without the unnecessary bloat found in other low-code and blogging platforms. Everything is driven from Markdown files and HTML templates. I have no HTML or CSS knowledge and so this has been a good challenge to get a grasp on these technologies with a meaningful purpose. I am still figuring out an efficient workflow but being able to write posts locally in Markdown has already felt like a much smoother experience.

Deploying this site has been easy as [zola](https://www.getzola.org) integrates seemlessly with [vercel](https://vercel.com). I simply make changes and push to my git repository to publish the changes.
